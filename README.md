Module name: Application Architecture
Module code: IMAT3701
Title of the Assessment: Web Application for Online Shop Using ASP.Net MVC Framework
The learning outcomes that are assessed by this coursework are: 
1. Demonstrate an appreciation of the benefits of appropriate architecture
2. Develop appropriate code and tools to support each layer of the system architecture
3. Apply good practice in code design
The coursework is a group project of five students, consisting of a single assignment, worth 100%. In this coursework, students will develop a web application for an online shop using ASP.NET, C#, MVC, and n-tier architecture. The project focuses on applying good coding practices while addressing key architectural quality attributes such as usability, modifiability, and security.
